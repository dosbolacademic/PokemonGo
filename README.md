# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: **Dosbol Aliev**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon Go** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of Pok√©mon images along with their type (breed) using a public API**.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üéÆüê±‚Äçüëìüì±**
